<h1>Designed by Magic players for Magic players</h1>
<p>The Dragon's Egg was designed with practicality in mind.  We were tired of lugging around large bags that don't fit in cramped tournament spaces, and tired of junky bags that failed to adequately protect our cards.  </p> 
<p>The Dragon's Egg is lightweight and compact; it fits <em>exactly</em> what you need for Magic tournaments, FNM, or casual play.  At the same time it's built to last and protect your cards.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Why use a "repurposed backpack" for Magic tournaments when you can use a bag designed specifically for your tournament decks</li>
	<li>The unique domed "egg shape" compartment maximizes space</li>
	<li>Protect your decks for tournament play and convenient mobility</li>
	<li>Quick pockets for your limited decks at FNM or extra land</li>
	<li>Top compartment holds phone, ipod, wallet, counters, dice, pen and paper</li>
	<li>Comfortable adjustable/removable strap </li>
</ul>
