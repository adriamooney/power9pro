<h1 align="center">Dragon's Egg MTG Tournament Bag</h1>

<p align="center">The Dragon's Egg is a compact and highly durable carrying case for your Magic cards and decks. The best bag for keeping your cards safe at tournaments and FNM. </p>

<!--<p class="index_quote">"It feels solid, it&rsquo;s got a nice weight to it. I opened up the bag to find out why it felt so nice and discovered that the actual deck holding piece inside the bag is made of solid plastic. Not foam, not cardboard and not hollow. That one piece is probably two thirds of the entire weight. Yet, the thing is not too heavy at all." &mdash; Doug Sutcliffe, Las Vegas</p>-->

For Friday Night Magic or tournaments it's going to be the Egg. Carries dice, draft packs, tokens, the whole lot. And it fits my two unsleeved divine/demonic decks in one slot for the moment. Really digging it's portability - and unlike the fat pack boxes you're not worried about the top coming off and it spilling all over the place. </blockquote><em>Xavier Rodriguez, San Francisco</em>
