            	<blockquote class="small">The Dragon's Egg feels solid, it's got a nice weight to it. I opened up the bag to find out why it felt so nice and discovered that the actual deck holding piece inside the bag is made of solid plastic. Not foam, not cardboard and not hollow. That one piece is probably two thirds of the entire weight. Yet, the thing is not too heavy at all.</blockquote><em>Doug Sutcliffe, <a href="http://www.draftbetter.com">Draftbetter.com</a></em>

			 <blockquote class="small">It was a very big deal that [the Dragon's Egg] wasn't massive and unwieldly, and didn't look like a pocket book. There are other bags that are small like this, but your bag's unique design and construction assures that I won't be embarrassed carrying it around. </blockquote><em>Mitchell Filer, Forest City, North Carolina</em>

                 	<blockquote class="small">Personally, I'm enjoying the Dragon's Egg quite a bit - I have a fairly large collection and 27 decks - I use a Rook metal carrying case (the 4 slotter that carries about 22 decks) but it's too heavy for anything other than casual nights. For Friday Night Magic or tournaments it's going to be the Egg. Carries dice, draft packs, tokens, the whole lot. And it fits my two unsleeved divine/demonic decks in one slot for the moment. Really digging it's portability - and unlike the fat pack boxes you're not worried about the top coming off and it spilling all over the place. </blockquote><em>Xavier Rodriguez, San Francisco</em>
