<h1>Customized Organization for your CCG Collection</h1>
<div id="content">

<p>Every ccg player and collector has binder-after-binder of cards and corrugated boxes stuffed full of cards.  What a nightmare to organize.  What an even greater nightmare to access the cards needed for singles-sales!  the lack of organization solutions results in hours of rifling through boxes of cards, hunting down that elusive singleton.</p>   
<p>Itâ€™s a major issue repeated time and again on forums and within play groups.  The goal of the N-Dexers is provide a simple and <a href="quality.php">long lasting solution</a> to this problem by reducing the time needed for organizing and accessing cards. </p>

<ul>
<li>You decide how you organize your card collection</li>
<li>Label by name, color, set, or whatever works best!</li>
<li>Handwrite the labels or print using the <a href="printer_template.php">Template</a></li>
<li>Extra labels to adjust as your collection grows</li>
<li>Organize all your cards in <a href="storage.php">any storage container</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Change out the labels if you sell or trade cards away.  Whenever a new set comes out, you can <a href="ndexers_demo.htm" <a href="ndexers_demo.htm" onclick="window.open('ndexers_demo.htm','popup','width=340,height=270,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=500,top=200'); return false">keep it organized</a> from the first pack you open.</p>
