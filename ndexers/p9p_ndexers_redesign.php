<!--<p class="index_quote">"It feels solid, it&rsquo;s got a nice weight to it. I opened up the bag to find out why it felt so nice and discovered that the actual deck holding piece inside the bag is made of solid plastic. Not foam, not cardboard and not hollow. That one piece is probably two thirds of the entire weight. Yet, the thing is not too heavy at all." &mdash; Doug Sutcliffe, Las Vegas</p>-->

					<p>The final product is the N-Dexers: scratch resistant, transparent and gentle on cards. They are also lightweight and thin so they won't add excessive space and weight to your already crowded storage containers.</p>

You have a well-designed product; they're versatile (cards can go horizontally or vertically, the N-Dexers work either way); they're standardized (fit within the industry standard box) and yet do exactly what they’re supposed to do: segregate between groups of cards and, via file folder technique, make it easy to identify what is within each group. They’re customizable, and best of all they're not cost-prohibitive.</blockquote>
