<h1>High Quality Materials Protect Your Cards</h1>
<p> Power 9 Pro spent months examining different materials, scrutinizing plastics for scratch resistance, flexibility and durability.  We also wanted a solution that wouldn't damage our cards. </p> 
<p>The final product is the N-Dexers: scratch resistant, transparent and gentle on cards. They are also lightweight and thin so they won't add excessive space and weight to your already crowded <a href="storage.php">storage containers.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Transparent material allows you to see your cards</li>
<li>Lightweight, flexible, durable</li>
<li>Smooth and perfectly sized to protect your cards</li>
</ul>

<p> We designed the N-Dexers to last as long as your cards.  They're also designed to be <a href="customized.php">flexible and adapt </a>to your changing collection. </p>
